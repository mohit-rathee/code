# My Journey
Consider this repo as my programming dairy, which I will look at in future to observe my growth. 

## my framework to learn programming.
For me hard way is the most efficient way. Thats why I always play with the technology before building a big project and this repo is all about that. 

### current job
I __(want to work/am working)__ at low-level with languages like c and rust.

Know about how __[memory and assembly, operating system, different programming languages, different libraries]__ works to provide an amazing abstraction we all have.
